# Dossier: the end-to-end platform for AI-native product craft


## The Pain Point: actually building and shipping from idea to production

Going beyond vibe coding? Features and products get complicated, fast. 
- Agent context windows are limited. Long prompts and large codebases cause hallucinations and errors.
- Updating or adding code in one area breaks another. Frustration mounts, timelines stretch.
- There's no room for user feedback in a one-shot prompt. Your process must be flexible to iterate.
- Trying to use multiple agents? The challenge is bigger than worktree management - it's setting clear boundaries and context.

  

## The Root Cause: humans out of the loop

Too much context + too little observability when you try to one-shot a feature or product.
- It will take you dozens or hundreds of chats to build, all relying on your memory and organization
- Use plan mode? You're still shipping and changing too much code without involving humans or users. Overbuilds lead to breakage.
- You're building the PRD. You should be building the user workflow - that's the value. But you can't observe it in action.
- Without careful boundaries set in each agent's context, running multiple agents risks breaking the codebase


## The Goal: help builders iterate their way to great products, supported by a team of agents

*AI-enpowered product builders (entrepreneurs, product managers, designers and engineers) can easily iterate toward product-grade features and products with price control over agent context throughout planning and execution, across the whole product



## The Solution: the dashboard for orchestrating end-to-end builds with multiple agents

The dashboard for end-to-end, multi-agent AI-native building.
1. Work with an agent to build out the workflow from an idea.
2. Shape and prioritize features by click, drag and drop - no long chats
3. Priceley set agent context for each feature build: tests, architecture, design guidance, mockups and more
4. Trigger a team of agents to build piece by piece or release by release - each with clear boundaries
5. Review, test and track progress as the feature or product takes shape



## What's different? Focus on quality, observability and context control

Current multi-agent orchestrators help run things faster. Dossier will help product builders achieve production-quality by planning and targeting precise builds and updates across multiple rounds of iteration and multiple agents. Build for product minds.



## Why not use planning mode in Cursor or Claude Code?

- Forget reviewing long text-based plans. Plans are structured and visual.
- Easy to customize context per build
- Clear division of duties between multiple agents working in the same repo simultaneously



## Why not use Linear or Jira for planning?

- Too much bloat left over from tracking long development cycles and large teams.
- A ticket does not equal agent context. Tests, markdowns, visuals, directories and files, agent rules - agents need links, not just instructions.



## Stage: Prototype https://v0-ai-orchestration-interface.vercel.app/

This is super early, visual-only to validate the concept.


### What you'll see now:
- A snapshot of the interface - what an agent would help you plan from an idea.
- Dashboard built like a user story map: user workflows broken down into user actions, with features attached to each action.
- Preview ways to set context per feature, trigger builds, review code and context documents



### What I need:
- Feedback to round out the workflow. Feature ideas to get you from concept to production, with each step covered.



## Next Phases
- Add workflow generator (idea > plan)
- Connect GitHub for code and doc management
- Connect to agent CLIs for building
